"""ASSIGNMENT
It's common in videogames to do basic addition. For example, we may need to calculate the additional damage a sword deals when it is enchanted with a spell.
Our hero's sword does 250 normally but does an additional 75 damage when it's enchanted.
Calculate and print the result of 250 + 75."""
print(250+75)
